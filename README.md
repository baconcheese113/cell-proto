# 🦠 Cell Proto: The Cellular Universe Simulator

*Where you ARE the cell, and the cell IS you.*

Welcome to the most biologically accurate cellular adventure you never knew you needed! Navigate the microscopic world where proteins have drama, organelles have opinions, and ATP is the ultimate currency.

## 🧬 What Makes This Special?

- **You ARE the Cell**: Drive around like a cellular Uber driver, collecting resources and building your microscopic empire
- **Real Biology, Real Fun**: From realistic secretory pathways to actual protein trafficking - it's like being inside a biology textbook that doesn't put you to sleep
- **Hexagonal Excellence**: Because circles are for quitters and squares are for squares
- **Unified Cell Movement**: When you move, EVERYTHING moves - hex grid, organelles, transcripts, vesicles, and even membrane ripples. It's like commanding a biological mothership!
- **Multiple Motility Modes**: Switch between amoeboid, blebbing, and mesenchymal locomotion with unique mechanics for each mode

## 🎮 Quick Start (For the Impatient)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` and prepare to be a unicellular overlord!

## 🕹️ Controls That Actually Make Sense

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Classic cellular locomotion
- **1, 2, 3 Keys**: Switch between amoeboid, blebbing, and mesenchymal motility modes
- **Space/Shift**: Mode-specific actions (bleb burst, pseudopod aim, protease toggle)
- **T Key**: Toggle between "I am small human" and "I AM THE CELL" modes
- **Mouse**: Click hexes to build organelles (like SimCity but with ribosomes)
- **Y Key**: Debug mode for when things get too real
- **M Key**: Toggle debug meters for detailed motility state information

## 🔬 Current Biological Marvels

### Milestone 11: Motility Expression v2 System
*The one where cells finally move like actual living organisms*

- **🏃 Amoeboid Locomotion**: Fast pseudopod formation with protrusion cycling and handbrake turning
- **💨 Blebbing Locomotion**: Pressure-driven bursts with chain combos and precision challenges  
- **🔗 Mesenchymal Locomotion**: Adhesion-dependent movement with protease trails and maturity mechanics
- **🌍 Terrain Features**: Different substrates (soft tissue, ECM, loose matrices) favor different modes
- **📊 Performance Tracking**: 3-star scoring system with skill-based analytics
- **🎨 Visual Feedback**: Mode-specific membrane states, pulses, and trail effects for blind identification
- **📈 Telemetry System**: Comprehensive logging for balance analysis and preset generation

### The Cellular Machinery
- **Organelle Construction**: Build ribosomes, ER, Golgi apparatus, and more
- **Protein Production**: Complete secretory pathway with vesicle trafficking
- **Resource Management**: Manage amino acids, ATP, and molecular building blocks
- **Species Diffusion**: Watch molecules spread through your cellular environment
- **Membrane Systems**: Transporters and receptors for cellular communication

## 🎯 What's Next?

- **Mitochondria**: The powerhouse of the cell (because someone has to say it)
- **Cell Division**: Making baby cells (aww)
- **Multi-cellular Madness**: When one cell just isn't enough
- **Genetic Shenanigans**: DNA that actually does things

## 🧪 For the Scientifically Curious

This isn't just a game - it's a love letter to cellular biology built with:
- **Phaser 3**: For smooth 60fps organelle action
- **TypeScript**: Because even proteins need type safety
- **Vite**: Fast builds for fast science
- **SystemObject Architecture**: Revolutionary automated lifecycle management

The simulation features biologically accurate processes including realistic protein trafficking timelines, proper organelle spatial organization, and authentic cellular metabolism patterns.
