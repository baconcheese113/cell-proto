# ü¶† Cell Proto: The Cellular Universe Simulator

*Where you ARE the cell, and the cell IS you.*

Welcome to the most biologically accurate cellular adventure you never knew you needed! Navigate the microscopic world where proteins have drama, organelles have opinions, and ATP is the ultimate currency.

## üß¨ What Makes This Special?

- **You ARE the Cell**: Drive around like a cellular Uber driver, collecting resources and building your microscopic empire
- **Real Biology, Real Fun**: From realistic secretory pathways to actual protein trafficking - it's like being inside a biology textbook that doesn't put you to sleep
- **Hexagonal Excellence**: Because circles are for quitters and squares are for squares
- **Unified Cell Movement**: When you move, EVERYTHING moves - hex grid, organelles, transcripts, vesicles, and even membrane ripples. It's like commanding a biological mothership!

## üéÆ Quick Start (For the Impatient)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` and prepare to be a unicellular overlord!

## üïπÔ∏è Controls That Actually Make Sense

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Classic cellular locomotion
- **T Key**: Toggle between "I am small human" and "I AM THE CELL" modes
- **Mouse**: Click hexes to build organelles (like SimCity but with ribosomes)
- **Y Key**: Debug mode for when things get too real

## üî¨ Current Biological Marvels

### Milestone 9: Cell Motility & Unified Visual Transform
*The one where everything finally moves together like a proper biological entity*

- **Cell Locomotion**: Your cell can now move through its environment with realistic physics
- **Unified Movement**: All visual elements (grid, organelles, player, effects) move as one cohesive unit
- **Energy Costs**: Moving drains ATP because biology doesn't give free rides
- **Substrate Interaction**: Different surfaces affect movement speed and adhesion

### The Cellular Machinery
- **Organelle Construction**: Build ribosomes, ER, Golgi apparatus, and more
- **Protein Production**: Complete secretory pathway with vesicle trafficking
- **Resource Management**: Manage amino acids, ATP, and molecular building blocks
- **Species Diffusion**: Watch molecules spread through your cellular environment
- **Membrane Systems**: Transporters and receptors for cellular communication

## üéØ What's Next?

- **Mitochondria**: The powerhouse of the cell (because someone has to say it)
- **Cell Division**: Making baby cells (aww)
- **Multi-cellular Madness**: When one cell just isn't enough
- **Genetic Shenanigans**: DNA that actually does things

## üß™ For the Scientifically Curious

This isn't just a game - it's a love letter to cellular biology built with:
- **Phaser 3**: For smooth 60fps organelle action
- **TypeScript**: Because even proteins need type safety
- **Vite**: Fast builds for fast science
- **SystemObject Architecture**: Revolutionary automated lifecycle management

The simulation features biologically accurate processes including realistic protein trafficking timelines, proper organelle spatial organization, and authentic cellular metabolism patterns.

## ü§ù Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add more biological accuracy? Think mitochondria deserve better representation? Open an issue or submit a PR! 

Just remember: in this codebase, we maintain biological plausibility, architectural elegance, and the sacred principle that every cell deserves to move as a unified entity.
