MILESTONE 0 â€” FUNCTIONALITY AUDIT
Current Systems in cell-proto:

MAIN ENTRY MODULE:
Phaser game initialization - KEEP (core framework)
Scene configuration - KEEP (game scene only)
Physics configuration - KEEP (needed for movement)
Scale/resize handling - KEEP (responsive gameplay)

Status: Keep as-is - minimal and focused
